## Project Description 

GameFound is a simple, game-finding application that uses the RAWG Video Game Database API to recommend a wishlist of games, based on user-chosen criteria. The purpose of this project was to take the guesswork out of finding a new game for one's gaming hobby - with GameFound, one may find the game they're looking for immediately. Choose from among four criteria to limit the choice of games, and GameFound will return what you're looking for.

## Usage 

Users may select from a variety of criteria, such as platform (game console), genre, game length, and release date. By clicking the submit button, the custom call to the API will return a result based on a conglomeration of these choices, in the form of a carousel. Firebase also allows for user authentication, and users may sign-up and log-in via the the nav bar. Future updates will allow each user to assign gifts to their personal wishlists, for future reference.
